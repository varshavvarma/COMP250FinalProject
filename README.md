# COMP250 Final Project
Wrote several classes to parse and store a complex dataset of collegeprofessor reviews from RateMyProfessors.com. Used this data with the graphical tool provided to plot word frequency data across review quality and professor gender to reveal interesting trends about biases in language usage.
Used with numerical ratings on both the perceived quality and difficulty of a course from the site. Focuses on reviews from a subset of universities across a time span of 15 years, totaling 19685 reviews overall.
However, teaching evaluations are not an objective evaluation of the quality of a pro-fessorâ€™s teaching. Recent research has shown that teaching evaluations often demonstrate harmful biases, including gender bias.
In the first part of the project, I implemented the data structure needed to process and analyze the dataset. In the second part, I wrote tools to help you visualize the breakdown of word frequencies by numerical rating and professor gender.
